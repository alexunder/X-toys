# The description of the goal #

In order to get the offer of the top-notch IT company, such as Google, Microsoft Research, I must read some books, the excercises from books and the interesting software projects with enough complexcity. I will classify these tasks into three category:

* Courses

They usually come from the MOOCs, such as, [MIT Open courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) , Etc.

* Books.

Some classical books in Computer science fields.

* Projects.

In the early age, most of projects come from courses' assignments with the smaller scales. Finally, I will complete some larger projects.

* LeetCode.

It's a kind of very useful resource to parctice fundamental coding skills. I will do it with the course calls "CLRS".
